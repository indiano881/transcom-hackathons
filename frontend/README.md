# Running the Project
## Installing Node.js
Modern front-end development typically requires Node.js. I am using Node.js v22.17.0, and while I haven’t tested other versions, it should work with any reasonably recent version.

npm comes bundled with Node.js and works similarly to Python’s pip, so there’s no need to install it separately.

## Installing Dependencies
```Shell
npm install
```

## Starting the Development Server
```Shell
npm run dev
```

You can now access the system by opening your browser at `http://localhost:5173/`.
