# Running the Project

This is a **full-stack web project** with a separated front-end and back-end. To run it, you need to open **two terminal windows**: one for the back-end and one for the front-end.

Detailed instructions for running each part can be found in:

* `backend/README.md` — for the back-end
* `frontend/README.md` — for the front-end

**Important:** Start the back-end first, then start the front-end.

# Testing

Once both the back-end and front-end are running successfully, you can open your browser and access the project at:
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

For convenience, the project root directory contains the following ZIP files for testing:

* `test-site.zip`: A website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* `pure-html-website.zip`: Another website built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* `react-website.zip`: A website built with the latest version of [React](https://react.dev/), a popular front-end framework
* `vue-website.zip`: A website built with the latest version of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), another popular front-end framework
